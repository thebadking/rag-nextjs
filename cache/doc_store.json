I\\ndidn't write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are:\\nshort stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings,\\nwhich I imagined made them deep. The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then\\ncalled \\\"data processing. \\\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's 1401 happened to\\nbe in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It\\nwas like a mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines — CPU, disk drives,\\nprinter, card reader — sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights. The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then\\nstack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result\\nwould ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer. I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there's not much I\\ncould have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I\\ndidn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on\\nany input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting\\nof that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any programs I wrote, because they can't have done\\nmuch. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate,\\nwhen one of mine didn't. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical\\nerror, as the data center manager's expression made clear.

Now you could have a computer sitting right in front of you,\\non a desk, that could respond to your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through a\\nstack of punch cards and then stopping. [1]\\nThe first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself. It was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I\\nremember vividly how impressed and envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing programs\\nright into the computer. Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of nagging before I convinced my father\\nto buy one, a TRS-80, in about 1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good\\nenough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote simple games, a program to predict how\\nhigh my model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so he'd write 2 pages at a time and then print\\nthem out, but it was a lot better than a typewriter. Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college. In college I was going to study\\nphilosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the\\nstudy of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere\\ndomain knowledge. What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of\\nthe space of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed ultimate truths.

The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It\\nwasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal\\nmodel of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a\\nlanguage in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John\\nMcCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]\\nMcCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve\\nRussell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from\\nthat point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a\\nmodel of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match. It was this\\nthat attracted me in college, though I didn't understand why at the time. McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions. It was missing a lot of things\\nyou'd want in a programming language. So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't\\ndefined using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already\\ngetting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way — indeed, there was a bug in it that\\nMcCarthy had overlooked. To test a more complicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and\\ncomputers then weren't powerful enough. Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach till you'd defined a\\ncomplete programming language. And as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a\\ndiscoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that\\nhad this quality. Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle, why not\\n\\ntry? So I decided to take a shot at it.

The first person Altman dialed, however, wasn’t a larger-than-life Silicon Valley\\ntitan like Marc Andreessen or Peter Thiel—even though Altman knew them both. It\\nwas Joshua Kushner, founder of a boutique New York-based firm, Thrive Capital. Kushner had been working for more than a decade to get that call.

It was also unclear if AI would be a winner-take-all\\ncategory, or a commodified one, where any technological edge OpenAI had could be\\nquickly copycatted, crushing its profits.

The sale slightly more\\nthan doubled Kushner’s investment, giving him a calling card that validated his\\nacumen and his patience. “I didn’t quite fully grasp what a moment that was for him and Thrive,” Systrom\\nsays now. “I didn’t do it because I thought I was doing him a favor.

Due to a lack of affordable\\nand quality higher education slots for the majority of the population, the pressure to\\nget into a good university starts young, with parents enrolling their children in\\nindividual or group private tutoring sessions to get them ahead of the competition. In April, a student went to India’s Supreme Court to increase his final exam mark by\\n1 percent, from 98 to 99, because admission cutoffs were that high. In 2021, 1.5\\nmillion students took the JEE to qualify for 13,000 seats in each of the 23 IITs—\\nmeaning there were 115 candidates competing for each seat. And success tends to\\nbreed success—you’re more likely to get into an IIT if you have resources in the first\\nplace. You’re also more likely to be male. Coaching centers, of the kind Raghwani attended,\\ntypically involve living away from home, so parents often discourage girls (who can\\nbe as young as 13 or 14) from taking the exams. Women accounted for around 20\\npercent of IIT students in the 2022–23 admission period. The first female IIT\\ndirector was appointed earlier this year—not at an IIT in India, but in Tanzania. Priyanka Joshi, who graduated from IIT Madras with a five-year dual degree in 2021,\\ndescribes her experience there as “tough. ” She was one of just three women on her\\ncourse, surrounded by 57 men. Most of the faculty was male too.

They were\\nplanning on telling people themselves at some point, “but it happened within the\\nfirst week. ” The student says there are often cases of “ragging”—a college initiation\\nritual that involves abuse, humiliation, and harassment—on the basis of their caste. The Indian government mandates that 15 percent of faculty professors should be\\nfrom marginalized castes, and 7.5 percent should come from Indigenous\\ncommunities.

To date, no action has been taken against\\nthe counselor, who remains in full-time employment. WHAT HAPPENS AT the IITs doesn’t stay at the IITs. Since dominant castes make\\nup the majority of IIT graduates, tech executives tend to come from dominant castes,\\ntoo. The result is an exceptionally slanted tech ecosystem tilted in favor of dominant\\ncaste men—a system that has been mirrored in the US too. In 2020, it was a Dalit\\ngraduate from IIT Bombay who filed a suit in the US against Cisco Systems Inc. and\\ntwo of his fellow alums, alleging caste-based discrimination at their hands while\\nemployed at the company. “Given all the research on the reproduction of caste and gender in the IITs, it seems\\nthat these ideals of gendered middle class [and dominant caste values] shape startup\\nworlds,” says Hemangini Gupta, a researcher in entrepreneurial economies at the\\nUniversity of Edinburgh. “Continually, the middle class [dominant caste] man is\\ncentered as the ‘imagined entrepreneur’ … workers need to already have key\\nadvantages to survive in such economies. ”\\nEven though women account for 43 percent of total graduates in STEM in India, only\\n3 percent of CEOs in the sector are women. With a persistent glass ceiling, pay\\ninequity, and a prevailing social structure that expects women to first marry and\\nthen quit their jobs on doing so, this statistic doesn’t appear to be changing any time\\nsoon. Startups often try to look like they’re diversifying their hiring, but they’re often doing\\nlittle to make it happen, says Madhura DasGupta Sinha, founder of Aspire For Her, an\\nNGO that aims to support women’s career aspirations. Indian startups are known for\\nchoosing not to hire women to save on maternity costs. “Culture in the startups often\\nis not very woman-friendly—they need [to work] long hours and to travel.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"b8885c0a-d85b-49c9-a40b-4f12de239e9a":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"b8885c0a-d85b-49c9-a40b-4f12de239e9a\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Indiaâs IITs Are a Golden Ticket With a Dark Side _ WIRED.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"sQ+7Aeip9yrhPslHw+q2glrAZ3jIFl2vZ8tMc4gIU3c=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"22a1a132-0033-4886-b277-7a3ba9d359c2\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"R1lELXDAnEVGAEmN8OA5QLZkLV86GKvN12gm1MtZPzQ=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"b97c5394-cd3f-47c1-9199-01cf30d6f7bd\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"UBdOSFz01/ltzM3e4k7YvCDPNceEK6yh7MRVBYBzoMA=\"}},\"hash\":\"NxtQV076SQG+MHTkvSiql7Wh5Gcu+03Ke23gznCgt5E=\",\"text\":\"”\\n\\n9/10/23, 10:06 AM India’s IITs Are a Golden Ticket With a Dark Side | WIRED\\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/indias-elite-tech-schools-are-a-golden-ticket-with-a-dark-side/?bxid=5cec2526fc942d3ada098c15&cndid=40563647&esrc=AIHub-reg… 7/13\\nIndian startups are notoriously toxic workplaces, and are often in the news for\\nglorifying a culture in which employees are sleep-deprived, overworked, and\\nexpected to reach impossible targets. Scandals have been reported at unicorns,\\nincluding edtech giant Byju’s and food delivery app Zomato. The dominance of dominant caste men within the tech ecosystem is likely to be self-\\nreinforcing, since the economic opportunities that the tech sector affords remain\\nconcentrated in a single social group. “The software industry generates high concentrations of wealth and offers a passage\\nfor upward mobility,” Narayan, the sociologist, says. “If it excludes everyone except\\nsocial elites, it becomes one of the main sites through which social inequalities and\\nhierarchies are reproduced. ”\\nAlthough it is much harder to measure, the skew in the leadership of India’s tech\\nsector and its lack of diversity and representation—which starts at the educational\\nlevel—is likely to be influencing business models and technologies, from the way\\nworkers are treated to the design of algorithms. “What entrepreneurs and funders understand [and celebrate] as ‘risk’ and\\n‘innovation’ are deeply tied to gendered and [dominant] caste ideals and practices,”\\nGupta says. Tech company founders and senior executives are most likely to come from an IIT-\\ndriven, hypercompetitive, move-fast-and-break-things work culture, combined with\\na fair degree of privilege that insulates them from the negative consequences of\\ntaking risks. But the majority of Indians aren’t highly-educated, wealthy urbanites. That means architects of tech products—such as food delivery or other gig work\\nplatforms—have a fundamentally different experience of society from the people\\nwho will be working further down the chain.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"b97c5394-cd3f-47c1-9199-01cf30d6f7bd":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"b97c5394-cd3f-47c1-9199-01cf30d6f7bd\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Indiaâs IITs Are a Golden Ticket With a Dark Side _ WIRED.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"sQ+7Aeip9yrhPslHw+q2glrAZ3jIFl2vZ8tMc4gIU3c=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"b8885c0a-d85b-49c9-a40b-4f12de239e9a\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"NxtQV076SQG+MHTkvSiql7Wh5Gcu+03Ke23gznCgt5E=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"ab2d2455-e608-4457-b5a5-fb3d217bd185\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"ihXOSrDmLoZeVlgMNsRgb9ZWBSKkILfORIUKZWnIOLM=\"}},\"hash\":\"UBdOSFz01/ltzM3e4k7YvCDPNceEK6yh7MRVBYBzoMA=\",\"text\":\"It may be no coincidence that gig\\nworkers in India routinely report discrimination, shocking working conditions, and\\narbitrary dismissal, and that tech policymakers often make sweeping decisions that\\ndisadvantage millions of people in poor and rural communities. “Masculine risk-taking that emphasizes scale and speed as central to how startups\\nmap and materialize their growth and imagine their success [is prevalent],” Gupta\\nsays. “A migrant single mother living in cheap housing in one of the newer\\n\\n9/10/23, 10:06 AM India’s IITs Are a Golden Ticket With a Dark Side | WIRED\\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/indias-elite-tech-schools-are-a-golden-ticket-with-a-dark-side/?bxid=5cec2526fc942d3ada098c15&cndid=40563647&esrc=AIHub-reg… 8/13\\nresidential areas of Bangalore would be spatially placed at a disadvantage.

M. Turing (1950) Computing Machinery and Intelligence. Mind 49: 433-460. COMPUTING MACHINERY AND INTELLIGENCE\\nBy A. M. Turing\\n1. The Imitation Game\\nI propose to consider the question, \\\"Can machines think? \\\" This should begin with\\ndefinitions of the meaning of the terms \\\"machine\\\" and \\\"think. \\\" The definitions might be\\nframed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is\\ndangerous, If the meaning of the words \\\"machine\\\" and \\\"think\\\" are to be found by\\nexamining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the\\nmeaning and the answer to the question, \\\"Can machines think? \\\" is to be sought in a\\nstatistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a\\ndefinition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is\\nexpressed in relatively unambiguous words. The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the\\n'imitation game. \\\" It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an\\ninterrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart front the\\nother two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other\\ntwo is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the\\nend of the game he says either \\\"X is A and Y is B\\\" or \\\"X is B and Y is A. \\\" The\\ninterrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B thus:\\nC: Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair? Now suppose X is actually A, then A must answer. It is A's object in the game to try and\\ncause C to make the wrong identification. His answer might therefore be:\\n\\\"My hair is shingled, and the longest strands are about nine inches long. \\\"\\nIn order that tones of voice may not help the interrogator the answers should be written,\\nor better still, typewritten.

Alternatively the question and answers can be repeated by an\\nintermediary. The object of the game for the third player (B) is to help the interrogator. The best strategy for her is probably to give truthful answers. She can add such things as\\n\\\"I am the woman, don't listen to him! \\\" to her answers, but it will avail nothing as the man\\ncan make similar remarks. We now ask the question, \\\"What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this\\ngame? \\\" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as\\nhe does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace\\nour original, \\\"Can machines think? \\\"\\n\\n2. Critique of the New Problem\\nAs well as asking, \\\"What is the answer to this new form of the question,\\\" one may ask,\\n\\\"Is this new question a worthy one to investigate? \\\" This latter question we investigate\\nwithout further ado, thereby cutting short an infinite regress. The new problem has the advantage of drawing a fairly sharp line between the physical\\nand the intellectual capacities of a man. No engineer or chemist claims to be able to\\nproduce a material which is indistinguishable from the human skin. It is possible that at\\nsome time this might be done, but even supposing this invention available we should feel\\nthere was little point in trying to make a \\\"thinking machine\\\" more human by dressing it\\nup in such artificial flesh. The form in which we have set the problem reflects this fact in\\nthe condition which prevents the interrogator from seeing or touching the other\\ncompetitors, or hearing -their voices. Some other advantages of the proposed criterion\\nmay be shown up by specimen questions and answers. Thus:\\nQ: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge.

We do not wish to penalise the\\nmachine for its inability to shine in beauty competitions, nor to penalise a man for losing\\nin a race against an aeroplane. The conditions of our game make these disabilities\\nirrelevant. The \\\"witnesses\\\" can brag, if they consider it advisable, as much as they please\\nabout their charms, strength or heroism, but the interrogator cannot demand practical\\ndemonstrations. The game may perhaps be criticised on the ground that the odds are weighted too heavily\\nagainst the machine. If the man were to try and pretend to be the machine he would\\nclearly make a very poor showing. He would be given away at once by slowness and\\ninaccuracy in arithmetic. May not machines carry out something which ought to be\\ndescribed as thinking but which is very different from what a man does? This objection is\\n\\na very strong one, but at least we can say that if, nevertheless, a machine can be\\nconstructed to play the imitation game satisfactorily, we need not be troubled by this\\nobjection. It might be urged that when playing the \\\"imitation game\\\" the best strategy for the\\nmachine may possibly be something other than imitation of the behaviour of a man.

Digital Computers\\nThe idea behind digital computers may be explained by saying that these machines are\\nintended to carry out any operations which could be done by a human computer. The\\nhuman computer is supposed to be following fixed rules; he has no authority to deviate\\nfrom them in any detail. We may suppose that these rules are supplied in a book, which is\\naltered whenever he is put on to a new job. He has also an unlimited supply of paper on\\nwhich he does his calculations. He may also do his multiplications and additions on a\\n\\\"desk machine,\\\" but this is not important. If we use the above explanation as a definition we shall be in danger of circularity of\\nargument. We avoid this by giving an outline. of the means by which the desired effect is\\nachieved. A digital computer can usually be regarded as consisting of three parts:\\n(i) Store. (ii) Executive unit. (iii) Control. The store is a store of information, and corresponds to the human computer's paper,\\nwhether this is the paper on which he does his calculations or that on which his book of\\nrules is printed. In so far as the human computer does calculations in his bead a part of\\nthe store will correspond to his memory. The executive unit is the part which carries out the various individual operations involved\\nin a calculation. What these individual operations are will vary from machine to machine. Usually fairly lengthy operations can be done such as \\\"Multiply 3540675445 by\\n7076345687\\\" but in some machines only very simple ones such as \\\"Write down 0\\\" are\\npossible. We have mentioned that the \\\"book of rules\\\" supplied to the computer is replaced in the\\nmachine by a part of the store. It is then called the \\\"table of instructions. \\\" It is the duty of\\nthe control to see that these instructions are obeyed correctly and in the right order. The\\ncontrol is so constructed that this necessarily happens. The information in the store is usually broken up into packets of moderately small size. In\\none machine, for instance, a packet might consist of ten decimal digits.

Universality of Digital Computers\\nThe digital computers considered in the last section may be classified amongst the\\n\\\"discrete-state machines. \\\" These are the machines which move by sudden jumps or clicks\\nfrom one quite definite state to another. These states are sufficiently different for the\\npossibility of confusion between them to be ignored. Strictly speaking there, are no such\\nmachines. Everything really moves continuously. But there are many kinds of machine\\nwhich can profitably be thought of as being discrete-state machines. For instance in\\nconsidering the switches for a lighting system it is a convenient fiction that each switch\\nmust be definitely on or definitely off. There must be intermediate positions, but for most\\npurposes we can forget about them. As an example of a discrete-state machine we might\\nconsider a wheel which clicks round through 120 once a second, but may be stopped by a\\n]ever which can be operated from outside; in addition a lamp is to light in one of the\\npositions of the wheel. This machine could be described abstractly as follows. The\\ninternal state of the machine (which is described by the position of the wheel) may be q\\n1\\n,\\nq\\n2 \\nor q\\n3\\n. There is an input signal i0. or i1 (position of ]ever). The internal state at any\\nmoment is determined by the last state and input signal according to the table\\n(TABLE DELETED)\\nThe output signals, the only externally visible indication of the internal state (the light)\\nare described by the table\\n\\nState q\\n1 \\nq\\n2 \\nq\\n3\\noutput o\\n0 \\no\\n0 \\no\\n1\\nThis example is typical of discrete-state machines.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"ae162a8c-9dc4-4b87-a332-a6b6efc73d08":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"ae162a8c-9dc4-4b87-a332-a6b6efc73d08\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/turing.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"Q6JNBEr/wYmoQ+U6qL5mcTaq4AIdT0Nc8pBEzYlgr2s=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"5c74bb2c-5a27-4061-8516-18dabb12c07c\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"A8BKSnyJrE70xN3764qm9F3BcfQRpj4Z05ZRDcJ/sw8=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"d2855838-e13a-4c0b-9244-fecbb5a680e6\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"zd8QKTG+Dt/jhtR1VaBKSoqINj2KEjk38mA6uZrwBAc=\"}},\"hash\":\"l5wLt/Qu8nRuHoOy70KNarPiJs0eeCpDp3v8DWtY93U=\",\"text\":\"They can be described by such tables\\nprovided they have only a finite number of possible states. It will seem that given the initial state of the machine and the input signals it is always\\npossible to predict all future states, This is reminiscent of Laplace's view that from the\\ncomplete state of the universe at one moment of time, as described by the positions and\\nvelocities of all particles, it should be possible to predict all future states. The prediction\\nwhich we are considering is, however, rather nearer to practicability than that considered\\nby Laplace. The system of the \\\"universe as a whole\\\" is such that quite small errors in the\\ninitial conditions can have an overwhelming effect at a later time. The displacement of a\\nsingle electron by a billionth of a centimetre at one moment might make the difference\\nbetween a man being killed by an avalanche a year later, or escaping. It is an essential\\nproperty of the mechanical systems which we have called \\\"discrete-state machines\\\" that\\nthis phenomenon does not occur. Even when we consider the actual physical machines\\ninstead of the idealised machines, reasonably accurate knowledge of the state at one\\nmoment yields reasonably accurate knowledge any number of steps later. As we have mentioned, digital computers fall within the class of discrete-state machines. But the number of states of which such a machine is capable is usually enormously large. For instance, the number for the machine now working at Manchester is about 2 \\n165,000\\n,\\ni.e., about 10 \\n50,000\\n.

God has given an immortal soul to every\\nman and woman, but not to any other animal or to machines. Hence no animal or\\nmachine can think. I am unable to accept any part of this, but will attempt to reply in theological terms. I\\nshould find the argument more convincing if animals were classed with men, for there is\\na greater difference, to my mind, between the typical animate and the inanimate than\\nthere is between man and the other animals. The arbitrary character of the orthodox view\\nbecomes clearer if we consider how it might appear to a member of some other religious\\ncommunity. How do Christians regard the Moslem view that women have no souls? But\\nlet us leave this point aside and return to the main argument. It appears to me that the\\nargument quoted above implies a serious restriction of the omnipotence of the Almighty. It is admitted that there are certain things that He cannot do such as making one equal to\\ntwo, but should we not believe that He has freedom to confer a soul on an elephant if He\\nsees fit? We might expect that He would only exercise this power in conjunction with a\\nmutation which provided the elephant with an appropriately improved brain to minister to\\nthe needs of this sort[. An argument of exactly similar form may be made for the case of\\nmachines.

In attempting to construct such machines we should not be\\nirreverently usurping His power of creating souls, any more than we are in the\\nprocreation of children: rather we are, in either case, instruments of His will providing\\n.mansions for the souls that He creates. However, this is mere speculation. I am not very impressed with theological arguments\\nwhatever they may be used to support. Such arguments have often been found\\nunsatisfactory in the past.

(2) The \\\"Heads in the Sand\\\" Objection\\nThe consequences of machines thinking would be too dreadful. Let us hope and believe\\nthat they cannot do so. \\\"\\nThis argument is seldom expressed quite so openly as in the form above. But it affects\\nmost of us who think about it at all. We like to believe that Man is in some subtle way\\nsuperior to the rest of creation. It is best if he can be shown to be necessarily superior, for\\n\\nthen there is no danger of him losing his commanding position. The popularity of the\\ntheological argument is clearly connected with this feeling. It is likely to be quite strong\\nin intellectual people, since they value the power of thinking more highly than others, and\\nare more inclined to base their belief in the superiority of Man on this power. I do not think that this argument is sufficiently substantial to require refutation. Consolation would be more appropriate: perhaps this should be sought in the\\ntransmigration of souls. (3) The Mathematical Objection\\nThere are a number of results of mathematical logic which can be used to show that there\\nare limitations to the powers of discrete-state machines. The best known of these results\\nis known as Godel's theorem ( 1931 ) and shows that in any sufficiently powerful logical\\nsystem statements can be formulated which can neither be proved nor disproved within\\nthe system, unless possibly the system itself is inconsistent. There are other, in some\\nrespects similar, results due to Church (1936), Kleene (1935), Rosser, and Turing (1937). The latter result is the most convenient to consider, since it refers directly to machines,\\nwhereas the others can only be used in a comparatively indirect argument: for instance if\\nGodel's theorem is to be used we need in addition to have some means of describing\\nlogical systems in terms of machines, and machines in terms of logical systems.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"5ce46cc4-23a6-4dce-9a23-9a381944ea32":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"5ce46cc4-23a6-4dce-9a23-9a381944ea32\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/turing.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"Q6JNBEr/wYmoQ+U6qL5mcTaq4AIdT0Nc8pBEzYlgr2s=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"017ae82e-4db2-494b-809c-0df6badf2f50\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"6QwM1/VuEbkuVGyParAph7nZbEGLmAkaD9f4yiEN7OU=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"80ace584-9510-4d7c-ab7f-316e439a622d\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"ToNEoNVv0iPyC+4KY2GkaPjte/kLuwzyK2Kj2qW7Wu0=\"}},\"hash\":\"XeFSWrVhRpyqnsErHz6MPVANl2wjb2DGBO44clo2iVo=\",\"text\":\"The\\nresult in question refers to a type of machine which is essentially a digital computer with\\nan infinite capacity.

It is claimed that the interrogator could distinguish the machine from the\\nman simply by setting them a number of problems in arithmetic. The machine would be\\nunmasked because of its deadly accuracy. The reply to this is simple. The machine\\n(programmed for playing the game) would not attempt to give the right answers to the\\narithmetic problems. It would deliberately introduce mistakes in a manner calculated to\\nconfuse the interrogator.

Each such neutron will cause a certain disturbance which eventually dies away. If,\\nhowever, the size of the pile is sufficiently increased, tire disturbance caused by such an\\nincoming neutron will very likely go on and on increasing until the whole pile is\\ndestroyed. Is there a corresponding phenomenon for minds, and is there one for\\nmachines? There does seem to be one for the human mind. The majority of them seem to\\nbe \\\"subcritical,\\\" i.e., to correspond in this analogy to piles of subcritical size.

Product teams can\\ndirectly influence these Inputs with their day-to-day work. This combination of metric and Inputs serves three critical purposes in any\\ncompany:\\n1. It helps prioritize and accelerate informed but decentralized decision-making. 2. It helps teams align and communicate. 3. It enables teams to focus on impact and sustainable, product-led growth. Put together, the metric and the Inputs look like this:\\nWhat is the North Star Framework? The North Star Playbook\\n11\\n“\\nThis simple tree-like framework of a single metric and influencing Inputs\\nserves as a scaffold containing assumptions, beliefs, and causal relationships. Once you’ve put it together and tested it in the field, it serves as a sort of\\nformula, an equation that indicates your company’s and product’s fundamental\\ncharacteristics. The heart of the North Star Framework is the North Star Metric, a single\\ncritical rate, count, or ratio that represents your product strategy. This metric\\nis a leading indicator that defines the relationship between the customer\\nproblems that the product team is trying to solve and sustainable, long-term\\nbusiness results. For example, in 2005, when Netflix was still focused on shipping DVDs,\\nthe Netflix product team established a North Star Metric of percentage of\\ncustomers placing three or more DVDs in their queue during their first session\\nwith the service (see North Star in Action: Netflix). The team understood that\\nthis key statistic encapsulated Netflix’s differentiation strategy.

As you see it change (ideally improving!), you can expect your\\nbusiness results to change accordingly. 2 . RE SULT S AND VALUE\\nThe Inputs are just as important as the metric. These are a small set (3-5)\\nof influential, complementary factors that you believe most directly affect the\\nNorth Star Metric, and that you believe you can influence through your\\nproduct offering. For example, Instacart, a same-day grocery delivery and pick-up service,\\nidentified four Inputs into a North Star Metric of total monthly items received\\non time. They need (1) lots of customers placing orders. Those orders ideally\\ncontain (2) lots of items. Instacart needs to fulfill (3) lots of orders. And (4) the\\norders need to be delivered on time. Inputs can vary a great deal by industry, business model, and a product’s\\nunique characteristics. The key is to identify the key factors that contribute\\nto the North Star Metric for your business. We view the North Star Metric as a\\nfunction of key Inputs that are both descriptive and actionable. 3.

They then mobilized teams (called\\n“squads” in Burger King’s organization) to drive these Inputs, as illustrated in\\nthe following figure. A Real-World Example: Burger King\\n\\n14\\nThe North Star Playbook\\nThe Burger King squads are able to trace the feature work that they prioritize\\nthrough their development processes first to these Inputs, and then to their\\nDigital Transactions Per User North Star Metric. For example, one squad\\nprioritized a “mobile order only coupons” initiative to drive the “frequency”\\nInput—a factor in the metric. Elie Javice, head of technical product management at Burger King, says\\n“[Our North Star Framework] is actually what we use across the teams to\\ndrive growth… All of us are aligned to the same goals: we want to drive\\nbrand love and sales. But if we set those as goals, we will all go in different\\ndirections, without focus.

A good North Star Metric represents what customers value about your product. When teams fail to connect their North Star Metric to customer value, they risk\\nleading their business down the wrong path. This means that simple counts of\\nusers, like “Daily Active Users” or “Registered Users,” are not optimal North\\nStar Metrics, as they say nothing about what your customers value.

Once you have determined your North Star Metric, see if you can find\\nyour product strategy and vision within it.

However,\\nsome businesses may have a mission that’s not particularly differentiated. That’s okay. If your business succeeds by executing well on a commoditized\\nproduct, for example, don’t worry if your North Star might not feel particularly\\nunique. Maybe your execution is what differentiates you. “\\nEach strategy we had at Netflix—\\nfrom our personalization\\nstrategy to our theory that\\na simpler experience would\\nimprove retention—had a very\\nspecific metric that helped us\\nto evaluate if the strategy was\\nvalid or not.

Ideally, your North Star Metric is predictive of\\nmedium-to long-term sustainable growth. For example, if you’re running a subscription-based product, you might\\nconsider annual revenue from subscribers to be a key metric, but it’s a lagging\\nindicator. Instead, a subscription-based business could identify characteristics\\nthat correlate with a user who is likely to renew her subscription, and then build\\na North Star around that.

Remember, the North Star\\nFramework’s purpose is to use metrics and Inputs to guide a product’s\\nability to satisfy customers and contribute to business success, not to\\nmonitor employee performance. Psychological safety is an important part of building a successful team\\nbecause it allows people to speak their minds, raise objections, or make\\nmistakes without fear of punishment or loss of status. You can foster a\\npsychologically safe environment by openly pointing out your own mistakes,\\ncelebrating challenges to decisions, and fostering an environment where\\nteam members can safely take risks.

Typical brainstorming sessions tend to be dominated by a handful of vocal\\nquick thinkers—the introverts and deliberators are stifled. Secondly, teams\\nquickly start building on the first few ideas suggested and don’t give\\nenough consideration to entirely different approaches. We prefer silent brainstorming, where teammates are given time to quietly\\nconsider a problem on their own, and then they each share their ideas in\\npairs or small subgroups and build on them, before sharing with a larger\\ngroup. Silent brainstorming works especially well with fill-in-the-blank\\ntemplates or other simple constraints. The North Star Playbook\\n41\\nPA IR AND SHARE\\nAfter spending time in silent reflection, it’s great to pair up with a partner. Partners can share their ideas with each other, refining each other’s concepts. Finally, share candidates with the group. Evaluate them against the checklist\\nand look for differences and commonalities. Some teams prefer a more formal\\nprocess with voting, ranking, and sorting (e.g. Bubble Sort), or scoring each\\ncandidate metric against each item in the Criteria for a Good North Star checklist. That’s fine, but keep in mind that it is the conversations that really count. Rachel Bethany, Amplitude’s manager of APAC Customer Success and\\nworkshop veteran, remarks, “Teams always seem surprised or concerned when\\nthere is debate and disagreement generated by the North Star presentation,\\nbut I usually think those are the best moments.

Chapter in Review\\n\\n44\\nThe North Star Playbook\\nNorth Star in Action:\\nNetflix and the North Star\\nFifteen years ago, Netflix wasn’t the media giant it is today. High-speed\\nstreaming technology wasn’t yet widely available, and Netflix still was\\nbattling traditional video retailers to satisfy the movie-watching public\\nthrough its innovative distribution model of DVDs mailed to consumers. At the time, retention was a challenge for Netflix. Notably, the first month\\nretention for new members, during their critical free trial period, was 88%,\\nwhich meant that 12% of members were abandoning the service after just\\none month. There was plenty of room to improve retention of new members,\\nand improving it could significantly affect Netflix’s business performance. Gibson Biddle, then the V.P. of Product at Netflix, knew that improving\\nretention would require patience, and he realized that retention was a\\nlagging indicator, not a leading indicator. He needed to identify a leading\\nindicator metric that his team could directly influence. He needed a North Star. So Gibson and his team dug into their data and customer patterns and\\ndiscovered a characteristic that proved to be a leading indicator of\\nretention for new members: the number of DVDs in a new member’s queue. They learned that if a customer had multiple movies waiting in their queue,\\nthat customer had become a more engaged user of the service and was\\nthus far less likely to unsubscribe. So they chose to focus their product\\nwork on a very specific metric: the percentage of members who added at\\nleast three DVDs to their queue in their first session with the service. “At Netflix, we knew that improving retention was the critical metric to\\nimprove—it would improve both customer and shareholder value.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"114e20fe-673d-48a6-98ca-bc1a4f87e70f":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"114e20fe-673d-48a6-98ca-bc1a4f87e70f\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Amplitude-The-North-Star-Playbook.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"wCIzVNEcbF6ZgNoDzi8T8zYJZcqzRFJ6F+7z1qZ3Iwc=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"59da841c-a117-474a-9120-1e1779a0e6aa\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"dzOttAIXtqEo23ueJ/DR/b76CEID1Qv7VNMGdXk3mpA=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"ed486d87-4fc1-4f0a-b329-772a8db6befb\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"5Frlr8M0C5UMVebhNpjmJZO59h5mBDs4jaanPS4qRbk=\"}},\"hash\":\"5mD/oQttwTcXmUvI+S5uOzcbzYD1m9G4rN61XX9CruY=\",\"text\":\"But\\nretention is very hard to move and A/B tests for retention require lots of\\ntime to see a meaningful difference,” said Gibson. “So we developed more\\nsensitive proxy metrics.

Amplitude’s product strategy is to be learning-driven,\\nproviding insights to cross-functional teams. WLUs represent this strategy. The core belief underpinning this North Star Metric is that Amplitude brings\\nforth deliberate learning that compounds with collaboration. Amplitude has identified three Inputs to WLUs that are related to\\nactivating customers and encouraging users to create and share their\\ninsights. Each Input is a key facet of Amplitude’s team-focused, learning-\\nfocused strategy. These Inputs are:\\n• Activated Organizations (AO). These are organizations that have\\nexceeded five WLUs. • Broadcasted Learnings (BL). These are things like charts, dashboards,\\nand notebooks consumed by two or more people in a seven-day period.

We experimented with using Weekly or Daily\\nActive Users (WAUs or DAUs), but Active Users doesn’t really\\ntell us anything about the value that was exchanged. Second,\\nWLUs represent Amplitude’s unique product strategy. It is not\\ngeneric.

For\\nexample, after implementing WLUs as their North Star Metric, Abbie’s\\nteam evaluated a request for a “Bulk Editing of Records” feature, a\\ncommon request in B2B products. Because of the North Star, they asked,\\n“How does this impact Broadcasted Learnings, Consumption of Learnings,\\nand WLUs? ” By asking that question, they were able to see past the\\nsurface request to understand the deeper impact on how Amplitude’s\\nusers create and share insights. The team discovered they could solve the customer problem behind the\\nbulk editing of records request and drive the Inputs to the North Star\\nMetric with a new “templating” feature. This feature works for advanced\\nusers but also gives new users a starting point—a template—for creating\\nnew learnings, thus speeding up their journey to becoming a Weekly\\nLearning User. In this way, the Amplitude product teams addressed the\\ncustomer’s problem through product improvements that directly affected\\nthe Consumption of Learnings Input and therefore improved their North\\nStar Metric. 58\\nThe North Star Playbook\\nChapter 5.

We need to increase our\\ninvestment in implementation services to stay ahead of our competitors. ”\\n• “Machine learning is the next big thing in this industry.

Similarly, developers often\\nstruggle to explain the value of non-feature or non-customer-facing work, like\\ntooling, refactoring, and technical debt reduction. Belief mapping is a great opportunity to get these concerns on the table. Developers should explain what they believe will happen if technical debt\\ncontinues to mount. Designers should outline how they believe that under-\\ninvestment in UX will result in customer pain. Connecting the North Star to Your\\nProduct Vision\\nYour business may have already done the important work of crafting a product\\nvision statement. These existing statements of product vision can be great\\ncatalysts to teasing out a good North Star. As your team defines your North Star, review your product vision statement.

The team equates their uncertainty\\nwith a lack of confidence or skill. So they manufacture a strong point of\\nview, even when—below the surface—there are a lot of questions lurking. Your North Star and Inputs should represent your current thinking, wants,\\nquestions, and all. For example, a team we worked with was under a great deal of pressure to\\ncome up with a personalization strategy.

Though we were still in our early stages, we knew it was important\\nto have a metric that we could use to drive clarity, communicate progress\\nto the rest of the organization, and hold product accountable to driving\\nbusiness outcomes for the company. As a product analytics solution, our main value proposition was helping\\nproduct managers and analysts answer questions, so we decided to use\\na ‘query’ as our indicator of value. That was important to us because our\\nmain differentiator from other analytics products was that Amplitude users\\ndidn’t just view dashboards, they explored the data deeply to understand\\nwhat drives user behavior. So, we aligned around a metric we called weekly\\nquerying users (WQUs) as our North Star. This worked really well for us—\\nwe found that not only did WQUs reflect customers getting value out of\\nAmplitude, but that this was also a leading indicator of our ability to retain\\nand expand accounts to grow our business. Over time, however, we recognized that this metric wasn’t truly reflecting\\nthe type of impact we wanted to have with our customers.

In a gap thinking model, teams examine the current condition, envision a future\\nstate, and attempt to define and close the gap between the two. The major problem with gap thinking, as it relates to any change effort, is\\nthat teams become vested in a fixed endpoint that never materializes. They\\ninadvertently devalue the present. There’s a lot of long-term planning and\\nexecution and long feedback cycles. When they don’t achieve the future—when\\nthey don’t close the gap—they lose steam and give up. If you find that your efforts to identify and implement a North Star for your\\nproduct are losing momentum, you might be guilty of too much gap thinking. Bloom contrasts gap thinking with present thinking. In present thinking, you\\nrecognize the reality of the present and work to change it. Present thinking\\nasks, “Where are we? What do I need now?

They’d nod, but you could sense confusion. “An\\nexperiment? ” they thought (and sometimes even said aloud). “When will\\nthis team stop experimenting and get to work? ” Or I would notice that\\nwhenever they wanted a team to do something, that same executive would\\nco-opt my language and say something like, “Oh, it is just an experiment! Give it a try! ”\\nI started to use the word “bet,” and noticed something very interesting. Executives, who understand concepts like risk, return, investment, and\\ndiversification, dropped their resistance. Bets make sense. Bets can be big\\nor small. Bets can be risky or safe. Good bets can sometimes lose, and bad\\nbets can sometimes win. With bets, I discovered a language to tease out assumptions and beliefs in\\na way that was a lot less forced.

Without functioning support systems—the\\ncirculatory, nervous, and digestive systems of the company—you start to see\\ndrag on the value creation system, like this:\\n\\nThe North Star Playbook\\n93\\nThis is why we often suggest that teams consider including a system health\\nindicator Input in their North Star. This Input can cover critical, non-feature\\nfactors that users might not directly experience but that indirectly affect the\\nproduct’s overall quality and the ability of engineers and designers to work\\neffectively. Examples of factors that can drive a health indicator Input include\\nsystem uptime, cycle times, testing and deployment processes, up-to-date\\ntooling, and even the time it takes for a new team member to get up-to-speed. Monitoring and course-correcting based on this Input will ensure that\\nthe whole system is healthy and set up for long-term, sustainable growth.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"2832ad38-5dd1-40c5-b784-a4b434fbf6f5":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"2832ad38-5dd1-40c5-b784-a4b434fbf6f5\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Amplitude-The-North-Star-Playbook.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"wCIzVNEcbF6ZgNoDzi8T8zYJZcqzRFJ6F+7z1qZ3Iwc=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"5e1932ab-24e3-4b0d-b244-288ac20b8404\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"Bzwy24b4bxqxGC4tg1a3uyHY5Ml15lL9Ww+y4bhnGFc=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"e49f55f1-4fa0-4664-bb7e-51283b30f0c1\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"+yHMq2Ux3RKwElRcZLWMTaSlt+h7eCGDvK5VqYQV9Bk=\"}},\"hash\":\"onbGUdtCcEOOnW1Pa4rn/IXo5fydNi34cGDPPcaTJGU=\",\"text\":\"Troy Magennis, product development measurement enthusiast, says, “Most\\nimportant is that health is a balance.

Include these opportunities in the roadmap. • Consider including a system health indicator Input in your North Star\\nFramework. • Reframe technical debt as drag on value to emphasize how it limits impact\\nand affects business results. The North Star Framework and\\nOrganizational Design\\nWe recommend that you don’t overhaul your org chart when you get started\\nwith the North Star Framework, as you’ll already have plenty to consider and\\nmanage. Once your North Star is performing well and producing a few months\\nor quarters of learning and success, you can turn your attention to optimizing\\nyour org structure to get the most out of the North Star. Tips for designing an organization around the North Star Framework:\\n• Consider letting a team or group of teams focus on a single Input for an\\nextended period of time. Amplitude refers to this product team structure\\nas pods. • Organize to minimize handoffs. Start together whenever possible. • Organize your teams around what is valuable. Resist letting your current\\norganizational structure force decisions about value and priorities. Be\\ncautious about organizing around features, workflows, touchpoints,\\ntechnologies, actors, etc. that do not align with your North Star and Inputs.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"e49f55f1-4fa0-4664-bb7e-51283b30f0c1":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"e49f55f1-4fa0-4664-bb7e-51283b30f0c1\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/Amplitude-The-North-Star-Playbook.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"wCIzVNEcbF6ZgNoDzi8T8zYJZcqzRFJ6F+7z1qZ3Iwc=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"2832ad38-5dd1-40c5-b784-a4b434fbf6f5\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"onbGUdtCcEOOnW1Pa4rn/IXo5fydNi34cGDPPcaTJGU=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"8ba22fcf-48a6-4e84-aec9-077cd4cdff33\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"5jnAdkm1YQVbkKCyBNHE2fHBvsZTGQMoz/tjteYHwBA=\"}},\"hash\":\"+yHMq2Ux3RKwElRcZLWMTaSlt+h7eCGDvK5VqYQV9Bk=\",\"text\":\"that do not align with your North Star and Inputs. • Remember that there is no optimal organizational structure for product\\ndevelopment.

What we like most about the North Star Framework, though, is the way it\\ninspires valuable conversations. To identify, design, and implement their North\\nStar, teams step away from screens, Jira tickets, and status updates, and they\\nspend time deeply engaged with one another—sharing ideas and learning. Yes, the framework and workshop are intentionally oversimplified. Yes,\\nunpacking your product strategy is hard. And yes, you will leave the room\\nwith nagging disagreements. But through this work you’ll have meaningful\\nconversations: about beliefs and assumptions, strategy and value exchanges,\\nusers and customers, Inputs and outputs, leading and lagging, your game and\\nyour bets. In these conversations you’ll discover what matters to teammates,\\ncustomers, and business—and as a result, you’ll build better products. 98\\nThe North Star Playbook\\nThe quality of your conversations is the real secret to the North Star—the North\\nStar of the North Star.

American cyclist Greg Lemond, two-time world champion and three-time Tour\\nde France winner, famously remarked that, “Cycling never gets easier, you just\\ngo faster. ” Think about this quote as it relates to product. We shouldn’t expect\\nproduct work to get easier, but we can find ways to make it better, to focus on\\nthe meaningful, impactful hard work—the “true work. ”\\nRecently, we spoke with a senior engineer who was frustrated.

She didn’t want work to be\\neasier; rather, she wanted her work to have more impact. This is the perfect\\nscenario for frameworks like the North Star Framework. We arranged a short session with her, the VP of Product, the product manager\\non the team, a designer, and a data scientist from a different product within the\\ncompany (a neutral third party can be a welcome addition). Within 30 minutes\\nthey were exploring some foundational company bets—things they all knew\\nabout but that they hadn’t really discussed. It turned out that the VP of Product was a natural at this kind of strategy\\ngymnastics, but had never really had the opportunity to share that skill. The\\ndata scientist talked them out of getting too theoretical (“As much as I want to\\ndig into this…”). The designer challenged some assumptions about their chosen\\nvalue exchanges (“We don’t know that, and need to do more research”). In 60\\nminutes, they had a couple of North Star Metric candidates on the table.
