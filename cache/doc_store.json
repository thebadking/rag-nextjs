When\\ndetermining variance in thickness, exclude the outside edges of a mailpiece\\n(1 inch from each edge) when the contents do not extend into those edges. Also,\\nexclude the selvage of any polywrap covering (see 201.5.3) from this\\ndetermination. Mailers must secure nonpaper contents to prevent shifting of\\nmore than 2 inches within the mailpiece if shifting would cause the piece to be\\nnonuniform in thickness or would result in the contents bursting out of the\\nmailpiece (see 601.3.3). 2.5 Ineligible Flat-Size Pieces\\nFlat-size mailpieces that do not meet the eligibility standards in 2.3 and 2.4 are\\nconsidered parcels, and customers mailing these pieces must pay the applicable\\nparcel prices.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"00bcd7e5-817c-493b-ac1c-157d1cec8481":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"00bcd7e5-817c-493b-ac1c-157d1cec8481\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/101.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"cYqwFXGb+Df3WDR7Eqk/czF3tgZa7F5O+UbkCTP4hT0=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"773866fa-a037-480a-8a4d-662feb5d210f\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"Ozambvw9EbayPYOFQ6q/U/A0KQa4pu/nk7Z5XafcRQE=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"5c546c82-b37c-4c20-8b40-0d5aee2bdfaa\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"QP4lgy5UR8v8UzbWbScoNm70qm9RWZfn0yaj7syl+4E=\"}},\"hash\":\"K+glkdXdBJ4uSBGLoSlcH0tyeDeLTT5Tmm6x4hznkNo=\",\"text\":\"3.0 Physical Standards for Parcels\\n3.1 Processing Categories\\nUSPS categorizes parcels into one of three mail processing categories:\\nmachinable, irregular, or nonmachinable parcel.

I\\ndidn't write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are:\\nshort stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings,\\nwhich I imagined made them deep. The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then\\ncalled \\\"data processing. \\\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's 1401 happened to\\nbe in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It\\nwas like a mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines — CPU, disk drives,\\nprinter, card reader — sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights. The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then\\nstack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result\\nwould ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer. I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there's not much I\\ncould have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I\\ndidn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on\\nany input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting\\nof that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any programs I wrote, because they can't have done\\nmuch. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate,\\nwhen one of mine didn't. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical\\nerror, as the data center manager's expression made clear.

Now you could have a computer sitting right in front of you,\\non a desk, that could respond to your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through a\\nstack of punch cards and then stopping. [1]\\nThe first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself. It was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I\\nremember vividly how impressed and envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing programs\\nright into the computer. Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of nagging before I convinced my father\\nto buy one, a TRS-80, in about 1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good\\nenough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote simple games, a program to predict how\\nhigh my model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so he'd write 2 pages at a time and then print\\nthem out, but it was a lot better than a typewriter. Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college. In college I was going to study\\nphilosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the\\nstudy of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere\\ndomain knowledge. What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of\\nthe space of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed ultimate truths. All that seemed left\\nfor philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored. I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at the time was that I kept taking\\nphilosophy courses and they kept being boring. So I decided to switch to AI. AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things especially that made me want to work on\\nit: a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer\\ncalled Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU.\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"f2f66e6b-679c-4c5e-b5d1-bcd6052e7010":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"f2f66e6b-679c-4c5e-b5d1-bcd6052e7010\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/paul_graham_essay.pdf\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"asSL/pV9tRVp/N8ZnbPn0KZ6qAVP4w72ChCKiwFpZko=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"50a76c82-b717-44d0-9c41-36eee733ac06\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"lW0ZKozZZOuSZiwBqrSJTq3mx1tOctTbm8q3F5nGYHs=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"90e24f4c-c3a4-457b-9851-25f8ff6f2d49\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"fNECMg9BOMVusr7RYTpVZnHCh/J/POOTQBbJLQRCOCY=\"}},\"hash\":\"O8Dxq3OtPAbUOhUIMa82ZQxJnEPx+ujPnYi86wRRitw=\",\"text\":\"I haven't tried\\nrereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was\\ndrawn entirely into its world.

There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach\\nmyself. Which meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. The\\ncommonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive, and programmers' ideas\\ncorrespondingly so. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the\\nsituation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was\\nyears before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what\\nI had expected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok. For\\nthe next couple years I was on a roll. I knew what I was going to do. For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God did I love working on that program.

Only Harvard accepted me, so that was where I went. I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first\\nyear of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the sort of AI\\nin which a program that's told \\\"the dog is sitting on the chair\\\" translates this into some formal\\nrepresentation and adds it to the list of things it knows. What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of natural language that's a formal\\nlanguage. But a very proper subset. It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching\\nSHRDLU more words.

I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in what\\nmust have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5\\nweeks or so that remained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I could, and I was able to\\nrespond, with no perceptible delay \\\"Yes, I think so.

So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint\\na generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you're painting.

You don't want to stop there, of\\ncourse, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what makes a still life interesting is that it's been\\nthrough a head. You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example, that the reason the\\ncolor changes suddenly at a certain point is that it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such\\nthings you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical\\nsense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense.

McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions. It was missing a lot of things\\nyou'd want in a programming language. So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't\\ndefined using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs.

To test a more complicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and\\ncomputers then weren't powerful enough. Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach till you'd defined a\\ncomplete programming language.

Now that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing\\nessays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose\\nwhat to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer\\n\\nthat question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be.

So if you string together\\na lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way. [3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old\\nFlorence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery,\\nand then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at street level in every possible condition,\\nfrom empty dark winter evenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with\\ntourists.

The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price. [8] Most software you can launch as soon as it's done. But when the software is an online store builder\\nand you're hosting the stores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So\\nbefore we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of\\nusers and making sure they had decent-looking stores.

[12] There is a general lesson here that our experience with Y Combinator also teaches: Customs\\ncontinue to constrain you long after the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary VC\\npractice had once, like the customs about publishing essays, been based on real constraints. Startups\\nhad once been much more expensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap and\\ncommon, but the VCs' customs still reflected the old world, just as customs about writing essays still\\nreflected the constraints of the print era. Which in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e. less influenced by custom) will have\\nan advantage in fields affected by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete). Here's an interesting point, though: you can't always predict which fields will be affected by rapid\\nchange. Obviously software and venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay writing\\nwould be? [13] Y Combinator was not the original name. At first we were called Cambridge Seed. But we didn't\\nwant a regional name, in case someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after one of\\nthe coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator. I picked orange as our color partly because it's the warmest, and partly because no VC used it. In 2005\\nall the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying to\\nappeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside joke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a\\nred circle, so I made the YC logo a white Y on an orange square. [14] YC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009, because it was getting so big I could no\\nlonger afford to fund it personally.

[16] She reports that they were all different shapes and sizes, because there was a run on air\\nconditioners and she had to get whatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could carry\\nnow. [17] Another problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs when you both write essays and run\\na forum. When you run a forum, you're assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every\\nconversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post highly imaginative\\nmisinterpretations of them on forums. Individually these two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but\\nthe combination is disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations, because the\\nassumption that you're present in the conversation means that not responding to any sufficiently\\n\\nupvoted misinterpretation reads as a tacit admission that it's correct. But that in turn encourages more;\\nanyone who wants to pick a fight with you senses that now is their chance. [18] The worst thing about leaving YC was not working with Jessica anymore. We'd been working on YC\\nalmost the whole time we'd known each other, and we'd neither tried nor wanted to separate it from\\nour personal lives, so leaving was like pulling up a deeply rooted tree. [19] One way to get more precise about the concept of invented vs discovered is to talk about space\\naliens. Any sufficiently advanced alien civilization would certainly know about the Pythagorean theorem,\\nfor example. I believe, though with less certainty, that they would also know about the Lisp in\\nMcCarthy's 1960 paper. But if so there's no reason to suppose that this is the limit of the language that might be known to them. Presumably aliens need numbers and errors and I/O too. So it seems likely there exists at least one path\\nout of McCarthy's Lisp along which discoveredness is preserved.
